    Week 5 Session Follow-up

    Posted on: Sunday, September 29, 2019 6:09:57 PM CDT

    Dear Students,

    this week's high fives go to all of you for showing up at Career fair and doing your best. I heard from employers that they are impressed with each and every one of you.

    From your comments, I understood that you are not impressed with this week's participation grade research. It should provide an opportunity for you to apply what you have learned last week in the class and this week through participation research. I have mentioned several times that there is no right or wrong answer, you should provide an ontology/knowledge base/taxonomy for a problem of your interest and your understanding of what will your knowledge base do for you. I need to see whether you understand what I am speaking about and whether you are able to apply it (with little or no guidance). 

    This brings us to imperva talk as well. I found it illuminating and exceptional. I was extremely happy that you were able to hear several stories that are related to the course you are taking and your unique abilities you are getting at WT. However, I didn't see your enthusiasm in the class :( 

    I do appreciate your feedback and I really hope I will be able to provide you enough material to do research in this awesome field. The best answer I could give you for what you need to do in this week's participation grade research is go through what we have discussed, what is covered in the book and try to make an ontology/knowledge base/taxonomy for a problem of your interest. Trying to define categories, objects, relationships, trying to understand what you can do with it will help you understand the topics we are covering. 

    I will post this in forum as well, and please, reply in that thread:

    For this week's participation grade research, please, make an ontology/knowledge base/taxonomy for following problems:

    Ibsa will build an ontology to try to understand what students need to do related to Career EXPO

    Jecsan will build an ontology to try to understand how to host a hackathon sponsored by Digital Ocean

    TJ Buecker will build an ontology to try to understand the game of cat and mouse in a large grid system

    Matthew will build an ontology to try to understand what he needs for his team project (video game that will learn from the opponents attacks)

    Musa will build an ontology to try to understand Career Fair follow-ups from an international student point of view (this is interesting to compare with Ibsa's ontology)

    Andrew will build an ontology to try to understand what he needs for Food waste project (please, let me know whether that is OK)

    TJ Moore would like to expand upon the knowledge base of a game called Hexapawn like how we did "Wumpus World" in last weeks lecture

    An plans to build ontology/knowledge base/taxonomy for the process of building a PC

    London will try to represent some ideas for a team project via a kind of mental map, and mapping ideas to various pros and cons and to conclusions such as FEASIBLE, INFEASIBLE, NEED MORE INFORMATION

    Steven, please, let me know what you will build ontology upon, as I don't have enough information to guide you

    Rachel will build ontology for understanding how to eliminate noise with the hearing aids (please, let me know whether that is OK)

    Atef will build an ontology with the goal to identify animals based on their features

    Daniel, please, let me know what you will build ontology upon, as I don't have enough information to guide you

    Career Fair

    Posted on: Thursday, September 26, 2019 8:35:31 AM CDT

    Dear Students,

    I have exciting news and ideas for you! I am sorry for duplicate message(s) I wanted to make sure that everyone got the info about:

    I) Imperva coming to speak with you

    II) Career Fair idea that I wanted to share

    I) Imperva is coming to speak with you today in class (OS) at 5pm and tomorrow in class (AI) at 9:30am. I would suggest that you make sure that you are coming to class prepared for a lot of fun. I spoke to Imperva representatives yesterday and they have exciting stories for you. There is also a lot of overlapping information with what I have been teaching, but when you hear it from a different perspective it might resonate better. 

    II) I wanted to suggest that you add upon what was suggested in Career Fair elevator pitch instructions. Fifth item would be the most important IMHO: 

    - Find something interesting and believable that you are excited about from a story/connection with the employer that you need to follow up. For example, this is my elevator pitch for today:

    Good morning, my name is Dusan Ramljak, I am a new professor of Data Science here at WT. From my research I understood that your company has a need for storage systems engineers. I have been working with HPE, Dell, Salesforce, Intel and other companies on NSF umbrella project which enables and enforces industry and academia collaboration. In this umbrella project a company would spend $50K per project and get assigned a student to work closely with company representative on new exciting research. This benefits the company as they get to know  a student who is interested to work with them and how he can handle a real project for a relatively small investment. We made a little twist to the project and assigned multiple teams on each project, such that a company has more opportunity to choose from several students for the same initial investment. If you are interested to hear more about the project and find the ways how we could collaborate here is my business card. Also, even if this project is not possible to organize with your company I would still be interested to get in touch with you and ask you to speak with my students about exciting projects that you think my students could work on. Is it OK if I contact you about that? 

    I am sure that plenty of you will still not get this message on time and that's OK. Please, post on forum how many companies you got in touch with (you don't have to go into specifics if you don't want to - number is enough) and what ways you used to do that.

    Have a lot of fun!

    Week 4 Session Follow-up

    Posted on: Friday, September 20, 2019 5:43:38 PM CDT

    Dear Students,

    I did speak with my colleague today after our class. We succeeded to define problem as one of CSP and he will hopefully publish his work in one of the storage systems conferences soon. I will try to organize some time for him to speak with you about how AI could be applied in storage systems at Oracle and he will try to organize meeting with his collaborators at Cisco to speak with you about how AI could be applied in networking at Cisco.   Here are important bulletpoints for today:

    I Our high fives

    II Participation grade

    III Quizes

    IV Career fair

    V Next week

    I This week high fives go to London for a really great participation grade research and Rachel, TJ. and Matthew for their feedback during and after our class session! Thank you. I didn't like the fact that nobody showed up yesterday at the Engineering Internship panel discussion. but I understand more your concerns and will try to do something about it!

    II For today's participation grade I have choosen one concept that you will comment upon for each of you

    Ontological engineering - Musa

    Categories and Objects - Rachel

    Events - Daniel

    Mental Events and Mental Objects - London

    Reasoning Systems for Categories - Atef

    Reasoning with Default Information - Ibsa

    Knowledge-Based Agents - Jecsan

    Logic - An

    Propositional Logic - Steven

    Propositional Theorem Proving - Andrew

    Effective Propositional Model Checking - TJ Buecker

    Agents Based on Propostional Logic - Hunter

    Forward Chaining - Matthew

    Backward Chaining - TJ Moore

    To get a full credit, you need to provide the following:

    1. Explanation of the concept - 20 points

    2. Explanation of the example that will serve to show what the concept is about - 20 points

    3. The code that runs on the example - 20 points

    4. Documentation of the code - 20 points

    5. Blog of your experience - 20 points

    The most important part of the blog of your experience will be what did you find hard researhing. Compare this week concept to last week. Was there more difficulties due to the fact that I diverted from the original plan and discussed something else I thought was important. What contributed most to your learning experience? How you can relate your learning experience with what you are learning about, if at all possible?

    Please, finish your task early such that we could comment and improve your learning experience. Please, note: If you **understand** all the concepts covered today, that is **all you need for the quiz**!

    If you missed the class or a part of it, reach out to me by WTClass Course Message or come to my office on Monday (office hours are 10am - 12 noon)


    III If you missed a quiz, reach out to me to make up for it. If you can't make the class, please, let me know. If you are stuck at home, let me know don't wait to come back to school. Thank you to all of you who did  what I asked.

    IV I am not able to offer extra credit for the Career fair :( I am still here to help you with each and every part of your journey. I will post my resume on forum along with notes from yesterday's internship panel.

    Please, try to come to next week's networking event in Legacy hall at 5:30 - 8pm on Wednesday. Bank of America, Broadcom (CA Technologies), CGI, Imperva, Rocket Software, Turnkey Computer Systems, and Visa will be attending.

    Career Fair is on Thursday at 10am in UBC.

    Imperva is coming to speak with you during the class on Friday.

    V Next week we will still speak about Logic - Chapters 8 and 9, and I will try to bring up concrete examples for both today's and next week's lecture. I will reach out to Imperva to make sure what they speak fits into what we are covering.

    Week 3 Session Follow-up

    Posted on: Friday, September 13, 2019 6:27:49 PM CDT

    Dear Students,

    thank you very much for a great class session today. I enjoyed sharing my experience (well frustration with scheduling algorithms or implementations among other things) and I am also glad I (hopefully) successfully didn't allow my problems influence the class . In this announcement I would like to address the following:

    1. Our high fives

    2. Team projects

    3. Quizes

    4. Participation grade

    5. What we will work on next week

    1. This session's high fives go to Rachel for great post and great explanations in the class. I am sorry that you find some things frustrating or not clear enough, but I hope I will be able to provide all the support for your learning process. Please, please, please, remind me if I forget something, indicate my mistakes. I am here to help you, but if you don't let me know what you need help with I can't do anything about it. 

    2. I was on the luncheon today and I got clarifications on some of my questions (well, I was rather reminded about what I knew already) Please, go to wtamu.edu/academics/undergraduate-research.aspx and see how to apply for President's Undergraduate Student Research. Why do I speak about that? I already told some of you that your ideas are great, deserve to be seen, some of those ideas we will not be able to realize for this class. So, you could take your idea to the next level and apply for the Internal Grant. Please, reach out about your ideas - I am here to help. 

    3. Quizes are open everything except communication among students. Bring open mind, understanding of the concepts we discuss in the class and you are good to go. Why do we have participation grade as well. CS and AI in particular is/should be IMHO community effort. I think that you should share your knowledge. You will get in the industry and you will need to explain your idea to your boss, to your co-workers who either work with you or for you. I hope you will realize that I am getting you prepared for that, slowly but surely. 

    4. Participation grade... I guess you are not so frustrated as some of your colleagues in other classes but still, I am sorry for saying that your colleagues' knowledge depends on you, well, to be precise that you should hurry up with your participation such that others could learn from you. I mentioned in the class that understanding the concept is enough for the quiz, but didn't communicate that message clearly.

    I hope it is clear now. I am the one who should explain the concepts to you. If it is not clear stop me, ask me, clarify whatever you need. If you don't get to it in the class, use the course messages/office hours/try to find me at some other time to reach out to me. Information that you might dig up in the assigned participation grade research might be useful, but it is not necessary. Once again, everything should be clear in the class and then you dig into one concept even further. Whatever is interesting for you, keep a note, and address it in your project. I am sure we will get to at least one concept that you will end up loving :)

    I will try to make a jupyter notebook with your findings and put that in this week's folder for you to have a reference of what we have worked on this week. 

    As I have realized in other classes, please, save your jupyter notebook as pdf as well, or post important text in the body of the post, such that whoever wants to see what you researched without opening jupyter notebooks can do it. This is not required for the grade! 

    I will open the forum post for you to reply to, as soon as I finish this announcement.

    5. Next week, we will work on Knowledge Representation, and Predicate Logic, chapters 12, 7 and 9. I think I have already uploaded the material I will use for presentation, and I hope I will make jupyter notebook on time. 

    This is not really for next week, it is just a reminder of what I mentioned in class. When we speak about search, game theory I felt a need to mention movies Beautiful mind and Social Network and speak about Social networks and recommend the literature: Any book written by Duncan Watts,  any book written by Albert Barabasi, Tipping point by Malcolm Gladwell, read about Stanley Milgram's small world experiment, and get a hold of researchy type of books by Jon Kleinberg.

    Have a lot of fun!

    Please check the Forum

    Posted on: Sunday, September 8, 2019 8:53:55 PM CDT

    Dear Students,

    I am sorry for delay in writing replies to your posts in forum. We got allergy issues and it was a tough 24 hours. I still didn’t get your choices, but however doesn’t know what to do, please check what Rachel (Mary Van Pelt) did in her thread: i choose iterative deepening. Good use of jupyter notebooks for the very first time, good explanations, great blog. 

    I forgot high fives for the class that go to Atef, TJ Buecker and Matthew. At the moment, I didn’t include a part of the grade for the high fives in class, sorry for that :( I am sure they will come up with full credit for their algorithms, right Atef, TJ and Matthew?


    Have a lot of fun!

    Week 2 Session Follow-up

    Posted on: Sunday, September 8, 2019 8:45:37 PM CDT

    Dear Students,

    thank you for bearing with me through, at least for me, a tough class session and thank you for providing a valuable feedback. 

    As I mentioned in the class, we will have to heat up/modify the participation grade. Here is how:

    There are 14 algorithms that we discussed yesterday (well, 17, but some we discussed very briefly if at all)
    Some of you have already chosen one algorithm that you will implement in Python. Please, let me know who choose what, such that I can choose one algorithm randomly to who didn't choose yet. To get a full credit, you need to provide the following:
        Explanation of the algorithm - 20 points
        Explanation of the example that will serve to show how the algorithm works - 20 points
        Code that runs on the example - 20 points
        Documentation of the code - 20 points
        Blog of your experience - 20 points

    There will be 20 questions on next week's quiz - 14 questions about algorithms and 6 questions that are based on yesterday's discussion
    Please, start early such that your colleagues could see your experience and prepare for the quiz!
    If you don't know how to finish the assignment reach out to me by WTClass Course Message or come to office hours.

    The example of what I want is already given in the presentation (chapter03.pdf, chapter04a.pdf, chapter04b.pdf). There is the explanation of the algorithm, explanation of the example to show how the algorithm works, pseudocode (which you could use as an example for the code and documentation that you need to make), explanation of the evaluation of the algorithm which you could use to know what to blog about. So, only blogging is not thoroughly explained, but seeing your explanations in the forum, I am sure you will be able to overcome the ambiguity. I expect that you make everything in jupyter notebooks, but will not mind whatever you provide.

    As for jupyter notebook, the default cell is code cell and default kernel is python 3.7. Whatever is not code in the assignment (1. 2. and 5.) you should change the cell to markdown. If you need help with how to use jupyter notebooks, feel free to reach out. 

    Once again, this assignment **should not** take too much of your time! If it is taking more than half an hour for you to do it, reach out to me, complain, and together, we will figure out where you are wasting your time. 

    Have a lot of fun!

    Closing Last Friday Participation - reminder

    Posted on: Thursday, September 5, 2019 6:13:04 PM CDT

    Dear Students,

    I would be grateful to you if you could check your grade for participation for last Friday. It is 8-30 column. If you have 0, share something with us on the forum. There are so many interesting threads, I will need more time to digest and comment upon everything. I am sure you could learn a lot sharing and contributing there. 

    If you think you got 0 by error, send me a Course message through WTClass (messages are coming through, I see them in my e-mail inbox, even though I can't find them in WTClass sometimes)

    Have a lot of fun!

    Master the Mainframe

    Posted on: Tuesday, September 3, 2019 2:58:17 PM CDT

    Dear Students, 
    I would like to offer some credit towards the labs part of the grade for your participation in Master the Mainframe competition.

    https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/z/education/master-the-mainframe-contest 

    Registration is a two part process.  The second part of the registration allows you to select West Texas A&M University. Registering alone is not enough, you need to participate in order to get the credit! Whatever you make out of it its for your own benefit, you will get credits whatever you do. 

    Heads up, one of the questions in the next quiz will be whether you agree to get credit for participating in the competition.

    Thank you!

    Week 1 Session Follow-up

    Posted on: Saturday, August 31, 2019 5:34:09 PM CDT

    Dear Students,

    thank you very much for making our first class experience great. I am grateful to you for your participation, amazing discussion and the great feedback I received. Some of the comments in the quiz and survey made my day.

    First, I would like to mention that I would really appreciate if you could read the book. Whoever read both chapters please read it again, whoever didn't read please do it. Questions on the quiz will be about anything and everything we spoke about and anything and everything that was covered in the first two chapters. As a reminder, other than what is covered in the notebook we spoke about where to find anaconda installation, how to start jupyter notebooks, where to find VM, and I pointed you to the material on how to install VM. I finally put it in the resources. The questions in the quiz and in any test will not require you to memorize anything - you would only need to understand the concepts! 

    That bring us to high fives and ways to earn them. I would like to thank Musa, TJ Tristan and Mary whom I know by Rachel :) for their voluntary participation and comments. I would like more participation from each and every one of you. I hope you have already learned that there are no right and wrong answers, that failure is not an option but a requirement and we have to learn from both failures and successes and everything in between! I need to get to know you to be able to grade you adequately. I will close off the grades for Friday on Friday before class and we will discuss it during that class session. If you think that you participated but you are omitted here in these high fives, and in the credits for participation, please, contribute to our learning experience in some other way. 

    Opportunities are abundant and here are some suggestions how to get a full credit for participation through forum discussions even if I didn't notice your contribution on Friday:

    - blog about why did professor who wrote a textbook choose the material I presented as the summary of the first chapter

    - blog about why I included stories I did include and what you have learned from it

    - blog about what is missing in the notebook and should be included as it will help our learning experience

    - let me know what you think that syllabus is missing that will help you understand what to expect from the class

    - find a good source (blog, website, whatever...) and share with us (Below are some of the websites/blogs that I am following and all are relevant for this course)
        Data Science Central, Kaggle, kdnuggets, Devpost, MLH (as in Major League Hacking)

    - contribute in some other way that you think is relevant (everything is a fair game as long as you participate in our learning experience)

    Please, let me know if you are not able to find our forum and if I didn't say that enough have a lot of fun!

    Welcome

    Posted on: Wednesday, August 21, 2019 7:07:31 AM CDT

    Dear Students,

    I would like to welcome you to our AI adventure! Please read carefully as I have exciting news which require your immediate reaction. 

    In this announcement you will find information about

    1. What routine I would like to establish

    2. What you need to prepare for our first class

    3. Exciting competition for which you might already be late, so hurry up, please 

    I would like you to work in teams on exciting/fun/cool/awesome projects and it is never too early to start thinking about what you can do. In order to do it, the best option would be to immerse yourself completely in AI topics. I will provide links to the material that I think is good, but feel free to find whatever you think is interesting. It shouldn't be time consuming, but it needs dedication and constant work. You would need at least to come to the classes prepared. I will try to quiz you at the beginning of each class. I envision quizzes as a tool to test your knowledge, progress you made on the team project, and your expectations for the class. At the end of each class, you will have the opportunity to grade me as I would like you to fill in anonymous survey from which I am supposed to understand how well I performed.

    Please, read chapters 1 and 2 from the textbook. I enjoyed reading it and I hope you will too, even though it is a bit outdated material. It will give you the overview of what is possible, what we are dealing with. Read it with the goal of identifying what is the AI frontier now ten years after the book is published. 

    Last but not the least, I was eager to share with you the opportunity to join Kaggle (kaggle.com) beginners competition. Whoever decides to go for it has to react quickly and will be adequately rewarded with extra credit just for trying and more extra credits if successful. Here is information from Kaggle directly:

    Beginning of Kaggle message:

    We recently announced an invite-only competition for beginner data scientists, where you can team up with other newcomers to explore and learn data science together. Everyone who takes our short Intro or IntermediateMachine Learning course will be invited on August 26.

    The response has been overwhelming. BUT we didn’t make it easy enough to verify your eligibility. So we’re doing two things to help you out:
        We’ll give you an extra week to take the courses and earn an invitation. Now you have until August 22nd.
        We’ve built progress tracking into our course home pages. To verify your eligibility, first make sure you are logged into Kaggle. Then go to the Intro or Intermediate course pages. If you see any progress on any exercises, you’re in. We recently had a bug where some users didn’t get up to 100% progress when they should have. So, any progress on the exercises for either course will be enough to earn that invite.

    If you haven’t started yet, we’ll still give you the extra week. Again, make sure you are logged in. Start either course by clicking on the first lesson. When you do the short hands-on coding questions in your browser, we’ll record your progress so we can send you the invite. Invitations go out on August 26. 

    We’ve found people stay motivated and learn faster when working together. So, the invitation will include a chance to sign up to be placed on a team with 3 - 4 other learners.

    I know (from my inbox) how excited people are for this social way to practice machine learning. Take advantage of the extra week to get that invitation and join the fun.

    Dan
    Head of Kaggle Learn
