    Please, let me know for which problem you will build your ontology/knowledge base/taxonomy for participation grade research for this week. Options include but are not limited to:

    - Career fair follow-ups

    - Team project

    For the actual participation grade research you will need to review the knowledge representation portion of what we covered last time, but here, you just need to explain what you are interested to build it for and why.
