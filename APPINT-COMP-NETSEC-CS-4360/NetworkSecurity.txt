DNS
---
Type A Record - Maps a name to an IP address
CNAME -points to another name rather than a ip
DNS works from back to front - start at . then com the etc
How do we find who owns things?
-SOA Start of Authority 
dig @8.8.8.8 -t NS com , the guys who have the root dns servers
- should not be query these servers directly 
AAAA (quad a record) - Ipv6 address record
MX (mail exchange)  - email records
in mx records the lower the number the higher the priorty

PTR Records, give an ip an name 
    lookup is reverse  right to left
SPF -  email who is allowed to send email from this guy (txt record)
txt records - not used often
DNS Man in the middle - redirect traffic 
DNS CACHE poisoning

IP addresses and net mask
/32 is the hostmask
Lowest IP is the netwrok ip addres / identifier 
( not usable as it defined the network)
( highest is also not usable as it is the broadcast address)

zero trust networking.

Firewalls:
Oldest -> newest
* Port filter FW- 
In port and out port are described.
* Stateful FW-
any -> dns server 53 
It remembers what port it came from and allows the connection
back to that port.
* Pack inspection FW
If a packet does not look like a expected protocol it will drop the packet.
* Application lvl FW
Deeper inspection and can act as a proxy.
* nextGen 
Does the same as the above but no proxying. 

iptables

least required , monitor everything
